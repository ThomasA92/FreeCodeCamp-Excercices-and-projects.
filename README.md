# FreeCodeCamp-Excercices-and-projects.
Here is a repository showing my "travel" into the <strong> FreeCodeCamp </strong> website and overall,its community. 


For now, i will be focused on <strong> HTML/CSS and JS </strong> as it is the staple for <em>front-end development</em>.
Later on, i hope to dive deeper into the back-end side so i can call myself a "fullstack " developer.

I already used PHP and Symfony and used PHP in a wordpress environment too.But it wasn't for a long time and coding take practice to perfect so i'm not used to it anymore.

I hope that i can get better and develop good practice habits by following FreeCodeCamp courses, may be this will even give me inspiration on various projects that i will deposit here on my Github later.

For now, i'll get started !
